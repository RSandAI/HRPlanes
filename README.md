This repository contains weights for YOLOv4, Faster R-CNN, and YOLOv8 networks trained with the HRPlanes dataset. YOLOv4 training has been performed using Darknet ([link](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet)), while Faster R-CNN has been trained using TensorFlow Object Detection API v1.13 ([link](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/r1.13.0)). YOLOv8 was also built and trained by our team using Ultralytics library ([link](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)).

## Updates

**The HRPlanes Dataset can be downloaded now! Please see below for details!**

### Latest Update  :rocket:

**February 2024:** The HRPlanes Dataset trained with YOLOv8x is now available for download. Please see below for details.

# Dataset Details

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RSandAI/HRPlanes/main/Assets/HRPlanes%20Samples%20All.png" alt="github.com/TolgaBkm/HRPlanes/"/>

The imagery required for the dataset was obtained from Google Earth. We downloaded 4800 x 2703 sized 3092 RGB images from major airports around the world, such as Paris-Charles de Gaulle, John F. Kennedy, Frankfurt, Istanbul, Madrid, Dallas, Las Vegas, and Amsterdam, as well as aircraft boneyards like Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. The dataset images were manually annotated by creating bounding boxes for each airplane using the HyperLabel software, which still provides annotation services as [Plainsight](https://app.plainsight.ai/). Quality control of each label was conducted through visual inspection by independent analysts who were not involved in the labeling procedure. A total of 18,477 airplanes have been labeled. A sample image and corresponding minimum bounding boxes for airplanes can be seen in the figure below. The dataset has been approximately split as 70% (2170 images) for training, 20% (620 images) for validation, and 10% (311 images) for testing. For those interested in monitoring closely, the sample images used in this dataset can be accessed [here](https://github.com/TolgaBkm/HRPlanes/tree/main/Sample%20Images).
